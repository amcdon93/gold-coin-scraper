# 🛡️ Cloudflare Codegen Guide

## ✅ Best Solution: Manual Challenge Completion

The most reliable way to handle Cloudflare with codegen is to complete challenges manually.

### Quick Start
```bash
npm run codegen-stealth
```

## 📝 Step-by-Step Process

1. **Run the stealth codegen:**
   ```bash
   npm run codegen-stealth
   ```

2. **Two windows will open:**
   - Browser window (for navigating)
   - Codegen window (shows generated code)

3. **Navigate to your target website**

4. **Complete Cloudflare challenges manually:**
   - Click the checkbox
   - Complete any captchas
   - Wait for the page to fully load

5. **Start interacting with the page:**
   - Click on products
   - Scroll through pages
   - Navigate through the site

6. **Watch the codegen window:**
   - It will generate JavaScript code in real-time
   - Copy the code when you're done

## 💡 Cloudflare Bypass Tips

- ✅ **Complete challenges manually** - Don't let automation handle them
- ✅ **Wait 5-10 seconds** after completing challenges
- ✅ **Move mouse naturally** - Don't make sudden movements
- ✅ **Scroll occasionally** - This makes you appear more human
- ✅ **Don't click too rapidly** - Space out your interactions
- ✅ **If blocked, wait 30 seconds** before retrying

## 🔧 Available Commands

- `npm run codegen-stealth` - **Recommended** (manual Cloudflare handling)
- `npm run codegen-working` - Basic working codegen
- `npm run codegen-cloudflare` - Advanced anti-detection (may be blocked)
- `npm run codegen-system-chrome` - Uses your Chrome (no recording)

## 🎯 Why Manual Completion Works

1. **Cloudflare trusts human interaction** - Manual completion looks natural
2. **Codegen records after challenges** - Only records your actual scraping actions
3. **No automation flags** - Avoids detection mechanisms
4. **Reliable results** - Works consistently across different sites

## 📋 Example Workflow

1. Run `npm run codegen-stealth`
2. Navigate to `https://example-vendor.com/gold-coins`
3. Complete Cloudflare challenge manually
4. Wait for page to load completely
5. Click on a product to see details
6. Watch codegen generate code like:
   ```javascript
   await page.goto('https://example-vendor.com/gold-coins');
   await page.click('.product-link');
   await page.waitForSelector('.product-title');
   ```
7. Copy the generated code and use it in your scraper

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Don't rush** - Take your time with challenges
- **Complete challenges manually** - This is the key to success
- **Wait after challenges** - Let the page fully load
- **Use natural movements** - Act like a human user
